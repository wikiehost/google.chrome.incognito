Google Chrome Incognito mode is a one-click solution for when you want to browse something privately. And indeed, once you close your incognito window, Chrome will forget everything about the session. This includes your browsing history, the given website permissions, the information you entered in forms, cookies, and site data.

All of this helps when you don’t want other users who use the same computer to know where you’ve been. It also helps protect you from some forms of third-party tracking employed by websites.

However, the actual privacy benefits that you get from this mode are limited. Let’s take a closer look at how well Chrome Incognito mode hides you. Spoiler alert: it’s not that much.


## How do you go incognito on Chrome?

**You can activate incognito mode manually or via a keyboard shortcut. To do it manually:**

Press the three dot icon on the top-right corner of your browser
Once the new window appears select New incognito window
If you want to use a shortcut instead, press Ctrl + Shift + N - this will instantly open an Incognito window.
